Disable Username/Password Logins

Once you have verified that your key-based logins are working, you should elect to disable username/password logins to achieve better security. To do this, you need to edit your SSH server's configuration file. On Debian/ Ubuntu systems, this file is located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config or sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Edit the lines, referenced below:
[...]
Port 2024
[...]
PasswordAuthentication no
[...]
UsePAM no
[...]

Save after changing the fields to look like above, the port can be something that is relevant to you and easier access. The rest are should be that way.

sudo systemctl restart sshd.server
sudo reload ssh
